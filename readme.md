# Femicide Stories

Requires pyserial and pygame.

Project for the course *Visual Thinking* of the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. The final version was lost to the sands of time and this is pretty incomplete (all the audios are missing for example, no schematic for the arduino set-up), but I felt like uploading something since I uploaded the [other project.](https://github.com/aecanales/aecanales.github.io/) And who knows, it might be useful to someone :bowtie: (...surprisingly, it seems Github doesn't support the rolling eyes emoji) 

Note to self, document your projects better! They make good portofolio pieces.
